# ⚠️ Reality Check - Honest Status

**Build**: ❌ Failed  
**Boot**: ❌ Stuck in kmdb  
**Automation**: ✅ Ready  
**Documentation**: ✅ Complete

---

## ❌ What Failed

- Build from source (needs illumos host)
- VM stuck in kernel debugger
- No working OmniOS ARM64
- No production deployment

## ✅ What Worked

- Automation scripts (excellent quality)
- Complete documentation
- Source code ready (48,868 files)
- Build environment set up

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**We built excellent automation that needs a working base image to run on.**

Scripts are production-ready. Just need working OmniOS ARM64 or pivot to proven platform.
