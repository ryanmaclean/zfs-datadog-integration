# EXECUTING NOW - ONE Kernel Build (Fixed)

**Time**: 19:22
**VM**: debian-zfs
**Status**: Building kernel with FIXED dependencies

## What Failed Before

- Missing `git`
- Broken `libelf-dev` dependencies
- No kernel source downloaded
- Build scripts failed silently

## What's Fixed Now

✅ Installing all dependencies properly
✅ Fixing broken packages
✅ Cloning Linux kernel source
✅ Configuring for M-series
✅ Building with all cores

## Current Build

```bash
VM: debian-zfs (ARM64, VZ backend)
Source: Linux mainline (latest)
Config: ARM64_CRYPTO, AES_ARM64_CE, SHA256_ARM64, CRC32_ARM64_CE
Cores: All available (parallel build)
Log: debian-kernel-build-fixed.log
ETA: 30-40 minutes
```

## Monitor

```bash
tail -f debian-kernel-build-fixed.log
```

## After Completion

1. Install kernel to /boot
2. Update GRUB
3. Reboot
4. Verify uname -r
5. Test ZFS
6. Extract and publish

## ONE Working Kernel

This will be our FIRST complete, verified, working custom M-series kernel.

Then we replicate to others.

**FOCUS: Complete THIS build successfully!**
