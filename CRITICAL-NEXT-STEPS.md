# CRITICAL NEXT STEPS - COMPLETE THE BUILDS

## Current Reality

**All VMs**: ✅ ARM64 (8/8 verified)
**Kernels**: ❌ None installed yet
**Builds**: ⏳ May have failed or still running

## MOST IMPORTANT: Get ONE Kernel Working

### Priority 1: Verify zfs-test kernel

zfs-test had custom kernel installed earlier. Check:
```bash
limactl shell zfs-test -- uname -r
# Should show 6.18.0-rc2 if custom kernel
# Shows 6.8.0-86 if reverted to stock
```

If stock kernel:
- Custom kernel exists at `/boot/vmlinuz-m-series`
- Need to boot it via GRUB
- Or reboot VM to load custom kernel

### Priority 2: Complete ONE Build Successfully

Pick debian-zfs (most reliable):
```bash
limactl shell debian-zfs -- sh -c '
# Check if failed
cd /usr/src/linux 2>/dev/null || exit 1

# Check if already compiled
if [ -f arch/arm64/boot/Image ]; then
    echo "Already compiled, installing..."
    sudo make modules_install
    sudo cp arch/arm64/boot/Image /boot/vmlinuz-m-series
    sudo update-grub
else
    echo "Restarting build..."
    sudo make -j$(nproc) Image modules
fi
'
```

### Priority 3: Verify Installation

```bash
limactl shell debian-zfs -- ls -lh /boot/vmlinuz-m-series
limactl shell debian-zfs -- sudo reboot
# Wait 30 seconds
limactl shell debian-zfs -- uname -r
# Should show custom kernel version
```

## What We Know Works

1. **ZFS verified** ✅ (on stock kernel)
2. **All VMs ARM64** ✅
3. **Kernel CAN compile** ✅ (did it once in zfs-test)
4. **Infrastructure ready** ✅

## What's Blocking

1. Builds may have failed silently
2. Need to check build logs
3. Need to restart failed builds
4. Need to verify completed builds

## ACTION PLAN

```bash
# 1. Check build status
tail -100 debian-kernel-build.log
tail -100 ubuntu-kernel-build.log
tail -100 rocky-kernel-build.log

# 2. If failed, restart ONE build
# Focus on debian-zfs only

# 3. Monitor until complete
# ~30-40 minutes

# 4. Install and verify
# Get ONE working kernel

# 5. Then replicate to others
# Don't start all in parallel again
```

## Success Criteria

**Minimum** (MUST ACHIEVE):
- ✅ ONE VM boots custom kernel
- ✅ Custom kernel version verified (`uname -r`)
- ✅ ZFS works with custom kernel
- ✅ Can extract and publish

**Next Level**:
- ✅ 3-4 VMs with custom kernels
- ✅ FreeBSD kernel working
- ✅ Benchmarks run

## Time Estimate

- Check builds: 5 minutes
- Restart ONE build: 40 minutes
- Install & verify: 10 minutes
- **Total**: ~1 hour to ONE working kernel

## EXECUTE NOW

Focus on debian-zfs. Get it done. Then replicate.
