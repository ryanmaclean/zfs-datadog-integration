```
✅ Already have working ARM64 image
✅ Fix ACPI boot issue
✅ Add our automation
✅ Install code-server
✅ Set up Datadog
✅ Create LX zones
✅ Production ready in minutes
```

### **Option 2: Build in OmniOS VM**
```
1. Boot existing OmniOS image
2. Install build tools inside VM
3. Build kernel natively
4. Test and deploy
```

### **Option 3: Cross-compile Setup**
```
1. Set up proper illumos build environment
2. Install all dependencies
3. Configure cross-compilation
4. Build (several hours)
```
