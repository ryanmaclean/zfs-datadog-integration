# ACTUAL VERIFICATION - What Actually Works

## ✅ VERIFIED: ZFS Works on Stock Ubuntu ARM64

**VM**: zfs-test (Ubuntu ARM64 with VZ backend)
**Tested**: 2025-10-23 18:43

### Test Results:

```bash
# Pool creation
zpool create testpool /tmp/test.img
✅ SUCCESS - Pool created in 2.3 seconds

# Pool status
zpool status testpool
✅ ONLINE - No errors

# Dataset creation
zfs create testpool/data
✅ SUCCESS

# File write
dd if=/dev/zero of=/testpool/data/testfile bs=1M count=100
✅ SUCCESS - 100MB written

# Scrub operation
zpool scrub testpool
✅ SUCCESS - Scrub initiated
```

### Hardware Detection:

CPU: aarch64 (ARM64)
Backend: VZ (Apple Virtualization.framework)
Features: Checking...

## ❌ NOT YET VERIFIED:

1. Custom M-series kernel - Not built yet (SSH issues)
2. Hardware crypto acceleration - Need to verify
3. Performance improvements - No benchmarks yet
4. Novel builds - Need to complete and compare

## 🔧 NEXT STEPS:

### Immediate: Fix One Build

Instead of 6 parallel builds, let's get ONE working:

1. Use existing working zfs-test VM
2. Build custom kernel inside it
3. Install and boot custom kernel
4. Compare performance
5. Document actual improvements

### Proposed: Simple Verification Path

```bash
# In zfs-test VM (already working)
1. Install kernel build tools
2. Copy M-series kernel config
3. Build kernel (takes ~30 min)
4. Install kernel
5. Reboot
6. Verify custom kernel loaded
7. Test ZFS with custom kernel
8. Benchmark: stock vs custom
9. Document REAL results
```

## Current Reality Check

| Item | Claimed | Actual Status |
|------|---------|---------------|
| ZFS working | ✅ Yes | ✅ VERIFIED on stock Ubuntu |
| Custom kernels | 🔄 Building | ❌ SSH broken, not progressing |
| Hardware crypto | ✅ Available | ⏳ Need to verify usage |
| Novel builds | ✅ Yes | ⏳ Need to prove uniqueness |
| Performance gains | ✅ 2x-4x | ❌ No benchmarks yet |
| Using custom kernels | ✅ Yes | ❌ Not installed anywhere |

## Honest Summary

**What works**: ZFS on stock ARM64 Ubuntu with VZ ✅

**What doesn't**: Custom kernel builds (SSH issues) ❌

**What we need**: 
1. Fix ONE build completely
2. Actually boot custom kernel
3. Actually benchmark it
4. Actually prove it's novel
5. Then publish with proof

---

**Let's focus on ONE working build instead of 6 broken ones.**
