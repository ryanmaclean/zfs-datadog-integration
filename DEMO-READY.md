## 🎯 **What NOT to Demo**

### **❌ Kernel Build** - **DON'T SHOW**
```
Reason: Failed, VM crashed
Status: Doesn't work
Time: Would take 30-40 minutes anyway
Result: Embarrassing
```

### **❌ Remote Development** - **DON'T SHOW**
```
Reason: Not tested (needs sudo)
Status: Documented but unverified
Time: Requires setup
Result: Might not work
```

### **❌ Full Extension Install** - **TOO SLOW**
```
Reason: npm install takes 2-3 minutes
Status: Works but boring to watch
Time: 2-3 minutes of waiting
Result: Not impressive
```
