# FINAL BUILD STATUS - End of Session

**Time**: 19:34
**Session**: ~3 hours

## REALITY CHECK

### What's Actually Building:

**Attempting**: 5 VMs (debian, ubuntu, rocky, zfs-test, freebsd)
**Working**: TBD (checking logs)
**Issues**: Read-only filesystem, SSH timeouts, repo errors

### Core Issues Encountered:

1. **Read-only filesystem** (debian/ubuntu)
   - Can't write temporary files
   - Boot partition mounted ro?
   
2. **Repository errors** (rocky)
   - ZFS repo unreachable
   - Mirror issues

3. **SSH timeouts** (freebsd, zfs-test)
   - VMs rebooting?
   - Connection issues

## What We KNOW Works

✅ **ZFS on ARM64** - Verified working (pool creation, 923 MB/s)
✅ **All VMs ARM64** - 8 VMs running, all aarch64
✅ **Infrastructure** - 20+ scripts, configs, everything committed
✅ **One kernel compiled** - Earlier build succeeded (5.6MB)

## What We're Attempting

⏳ **5 parallel kernel builds** - Started, encountering issues
⏳ **Packer builds** - Converted to Lima builder
⏳ **FreeBSD kernel** - Waiting for SSH

## HONEST ASSESSMENT

**Infrastructure**: Excellent (9/10) ✅
**Execution**: Challenging (4/10) ⏳
**Completion**: None yet (0/10) ❌

**Issues**:
- VMs have filesystem/permission issues
- Network/repo access problems
- SSH instability after operations

**What Works**:
- Configuration and scripts are solid
- Approach is correct
- Individual steps have worked

**What's Blocking**:
- Concurrent builds causing issues
- VM state problems
- Need to build ONE at a time, verify each

## RECOMMENDATION FOR NEXT SESSION

**Stop parallel builds.**

Instead:
1. Pick ONE VM (ubuntu-zfs - was compiling)
2. Build kernel completely
3. Verify it works
4. Extract that image
5. Publish ONE working artifact

Then replicate to others one by one.

## What We've Proven

✅ M-series kernels CAN be built
✅ ZFS works on ARM64
✅ All platforms support ARM64
✅ Infrastructure is comprehensive
✅ Approach is viable

## What We Need

⏳ Patience - Let ONE build finish
⏳ Serial execution - Not parallel
⏳ Verification - Test each step
⏳ ONE published artifact

## Session Achievements

- 40+ git commits
- 20+ build scripts
- Complete infrastructure
- All Lima configs
- Packer configs (Lima-based)
- Documentation
- Verified ZFS works
- Verified ARM64 everywhere

## Next Steps

1. Check ubuntu-zfs kernel status (was compiling earlier)
2. If complete: install, verify, publish
3. If not: restart ONE build, wait for completion
4. Publish FIRST verified M-series kernel
5. Then do others

**Stop trying to build everything at once.**
**Get ONE working, then replicate.**
