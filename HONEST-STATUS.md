# HONEST STATUS - What ACTUALLY Exists

**Time**: 2025-10-23 19:01

## REALITY:

### ❌ NO OPTIMIZED KERNEL YET
- Kernel is compiling (or may have failed)
- /boot/vmlinuz-m-series does NOT exist yet
- Build may still be running

### ❌ NO ISOs YET
- No arch-m-series.iso
- No gentoo-m-series.iso
- Builds started but not complete

### ✅ OpenIndiana EXISTS (but x86_64, not ARM64)
- VM: openindiana-seq (Stopped)
- Architecture: x86_64 (NOT ARM64)
- Can't use for M-series builds

### ✅ What ACTUALLY Works:
- ZFS works on stock Ubuntu ARM64
- Scripts are written
- VMs are running
- Builds are STARTED but not DONE

## THE TRUTH

**We have:**
- Lots of scripts ✅
- VMs running ✅
- ZFS verified working ✅
- Builds in progress ⏳

**We DON'T have yet:**
- Completed optimized kernel ❌
- Completed ISOs ❌
- Benchmarks ❌
- Proof of performance improvements ❌

## NEXT STEPS

**Stop claiming success.**
**Wait for ONE build to complete.**
**Verify it works.**
**Then publish.**

---

**HONESTY: Still building, nothing complete yet.**
