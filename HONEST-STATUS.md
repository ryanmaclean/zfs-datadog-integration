# 💯 Honest Build Status

## 🎯 **The Truth**

### **What's ACTUALLY Running**

✅ **VM is running**: `kernel-build` with 94GB free space  
✅ **Build tools installed**: gcc, make, git all ready  
✅ **4 CPU cores**: Available for parallel compilation  

❌ **Build script NOT executing yet**: The background process started but the script hasn't been copied to the VM yet

---

## 🔍 **What I Proved**

### **Infrastructure Tests** ✅
1. Remote storage working (6.1GB on tank3)
2. QCOW2 sparse allocation (10GB virtual = 196K actual)
3. VM configurations valid (7 scripts)
4. Environment config working (.env loaded)

### **Actual Running Systems** ✅
1. **ZFS VM**: Was running, tested ZFS operations
   - Created pool
   - Wrote 100MB data
   - Created snapshot
   - Verified compression

2. **Kernel Build VM**: Currently running
   - 96GB disk (94GB free)
   - 4 CPU cores
   - 3.8GB RAM
   - Build tools installed

### **What's NOT Running** ❌
- Kernel build hasn't started yet
- No compilation in progress
- No kernel source cloned

## 📋 **What Needs to Happen**

To actually run the kernel build:

1. **Copy build script to VM** (not done yet)
2. **Execute the script** (not started)
3. **Clone Linux kernel** (~2GB, 5-10 min)
4. **Compile kernel** (~20-40 min with 4 cores)
5. **Install kernel** (~5 min)

**Total time if started now**: ~30-55 minutes

## 🚀 **Summary**

**What I've proven**:
- ✅ Infrastructure works (storage, VMs, configs)
- ✅ VMs can run (kernel-build is running now)
- ✅ ZFS works (tested with real operations)
- ✅ Disk space adequate (94GB available)

**What I haven't proven**:
- ❌ Actual kernel compilation
- ❌ Build artifacts creation
- ❌ Kernel installation
- ❌ Booting with custom kernel

**The build CAN run, but ISN'T running yet.**

## ⏱️ **Time Investment**

To complete the full proof:
- **Now**: ~30-55 minutes for kernel build
- **Alternative**: Use the working infrastructure for other tasks

**Your call**: Run the full build now, or consider the infrastructure proof sufficient?
