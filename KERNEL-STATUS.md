# ⚠️ Custom ARM64 Kernel Status

**Question**: Do we have a custom ARM64 kernel?  
**Answer**: NO

---

## ❌ What We Don't Have

```
❌ No custom ARM64 kernel built
❌ No OmniOS ARM64 kernel
❌ No Linux ARM64 kernel
❌ No bootable custom kernel
❌ No kernel modifications
```

---

## 🔍 What We Attempted

### **OmniOS ARM64 Build**
```
✅ Source cloned (48,868 files)
✅ ARM64 branch checked out
✅ GCC 14 installed
❌ Build failed (needs illumos host)
❌ Can't cross-compile from macOS
❌ No kernel produced
```

### **Linux Kernel Build**
```
✅ Attempted in Lima VM
✅ Test build worked (tinyconfig)
❌ Full build not completed
❌ No custom kernel produced
```

---

## 🎯 Reality

### **Kernel Building is Hard**
```
- illumos: Needs illumos host to build
- Linux: Takes hours even on fast hardware
- Cross-compilation: Complex toolchains
- Testing: Needs proper boot environment
```

### **What We Have Instead**
```
✅ Pre-built kernels (Alpine, OmniOS)
✅ VM automation
✅ Fast downloads (aria2c)
✅ Deployment scripts
✅ Documentation
```

---

## 💡 To Actually Build Custom Kernel

### **Would Need**
```
1. Proper build environment (20-30 min setup)
2. Kernel source (already have)
3. Configuration (10-15 min)
4. Build time (1-3 hours)
5. Testing (30-60 min)
6. Debugging (varies)

Total: 3-5 hours minimum
```

### **For OmniOS ARM64**
```
- Need illumos/OmniOS host
- Or proper cross-compile setup
- Complex build system
- Limited ARM64 support
```

---

## 🚀 What We Actually Demonstrated

```
✅ Fast downloads (aria2c)
✅ VM automation
✅ Multiple OS deployment
✅ Serial console control
✅ Build environment setup
✅ Source code ready
✅ Framework for kernel work
```

---

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Custom ARM64 kernel?** NO

**Could build one?** YES, with 3-5 hours

**Is it needed for R&D demo?** NO

**What we showed instead:**
- Deployment automation
- Fast downloads
- Multiple approaches
- Framework that COULD build kernels

**Honest answer: No custom kernel yet.** 🔨
