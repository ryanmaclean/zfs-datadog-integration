### **FreeBSD VM**: ⏳ CREATING (Background)
```
Process: 95637
Task: Creating FreeBSD VM for ML testing
Status: Running in background
Time: Started ~1 minute ago
ETA: ~5-6 more minutes
```

## 🎯 **What We've Been Working On**

### **Session Focus**: ML Code Assistant Extension
1. ✅ Built extension (295MB with dependencies)
2. ✅ Installed on macOS
3. ✅ Synced to iOS via iCloud
4. ✅ Added BSD/OmniOS support
5. ✅ Created CLI tool
6. ⏳ Testing on FreeBSD VM (in progress)

### **Kernel Build**: ⏸️ PAUSED
- Last attempt: ~30 minutes ago
- Issue: Script had interactive prompt
- Fix: Removed prompt
- Status: Ready to run, but not started

## 📁 **Where Things Are**

### **ML Extension**:
```
macOS: ~/.vscode/extensions/mlcode-extension/
iOS: ~/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/mlcode-extension/
Linux VMs: /tmp/mlcode-extension/
FreeBSD: Creating VM now
```

### **Kernel Build** (if we run it):
```
VM: kernel-build (running, 94GB free)
Source: Would be in /usr/src/linux
Build: Would be in /usr/src/linux
Output: Would be in /boot/
Log: Would be in /tmp/kernel-build.log
```

## 🚀 **What You Can Do Now**

### **Option 1: Start Kernel Build**
```bash
# Run the fixed script
bash scripts/build-arm64-kernel-now.sh

# This will:
# - Clone Linux 6.6 LTS (~2GB)
# - Compile kernel (~20-40 min)
# - Install kernel (~5 min)
# Total: ~30-50 minutes
```

### **Option 2: Wait for FreeBSD Test**
```bash
# Check FreeBSD VM status
limactl list | grep freebsd-ml

# When complete (~5 min), you'll have:
# - FreeBSD VM running
# - ML extension tested on BSD
# - Proof of cross-platform support
```

### **Option 3: Use ML Extension**
```bash
# Reload Windsurf
Cmd+Shift+P → "Developer: Reload Window"

# Initialize ML model
Cmd+Shift+P → "Initialize ML Model"

# Start coding with ML assistance
```

## 📊 **Current State**

| Task | Status | Location | Time |
|------|--------|----------|------|
| **ML Extension** | ✅ Built | macOS/iOS | Done |
| **Kernel Build** | ❌ Not started | kernel-build VM | 30-50 min if started |
| **FreeBSD Test** | ⏳ Running | Background | ~5 min remaining |
| **ZFS Test** | ✅ Done earlier | zfs-build VM | Complete |

---

## 💡 **Recommendation**

**You have 3 things ready**:

1. **ML Extension**: Installed, just needs Windsurf reload
2. **Kernel Build**: Ready to run (30-50 min)
3. **FreeBSD Test**: Running in background (~5 min)

**What do you want to focus on?**
- Use the ML extension? (reload Windsurf)
- Start kernel build? (30-50 min wait)
- Wait for FreeBSD? (~5 min)
- Something else?

---

## 🎯 **Summary**

**No builds are currently running.**

**What's ready**:
- ✅ ML extension (needs activation)
- ✅ Kernel build script (needs execution)
- ⏳ FreeBSD VM (creating in background)

**Choose your next step!** 🚀
