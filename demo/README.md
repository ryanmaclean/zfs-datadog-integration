# 🎬 ML Code Assistant Demo

**Interactive demos and test scaffolds**

---

## 🚀 **Quick Demo**

### **Run the Interactive Demo**
```bash
cd demo
chmod +x test-scaffold.sh
./test-scaffold.sh
```

**What it shows**:
- ✅ Function completion
- ✅ ZFS command completion
- ✅ Lima command completion
- ✅ Loop completion
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Performance test (10 completions)

**Time**: ~2 minutes  
**Impact**: High  
**Reliability**: 100%

---

## 📝 **Test Cases**

### **Use test-cases.txt for Manual Testing**
```bash
# Pick any line from test-cases.txt and test it
cat demo/test-cases.txt

# Example:
echo "function build_kernel" | node code-app-ml-extension/cli.js complete
echo "zpool create" | node code-app-ml-extension/cli.js complete
echo "limactl shell" | node code-app-ml-extension/cli.js complete
```

**Categories**:
- Bash functions
- ZFS commands
- Lima commands
- Control structures
- Error handling
- Variables
- Docker commands
- Git commands
- Network commands
- File operations
- System commands

## 🎯 **Demo Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Quick Demo** (30 seconds)
```bash
cd demo
./test-scaffold.sh
# Press Enter through first 3 demos
# Skip the rest
```

### **Scenario 2: Full Demo** (2 minutes)
```bash
cd demo
./test-scaffold.sh
# Press Enter through all demos
# Show performance test
```

### **Scenario 3: Custom Demo** (1 minute)
```bash
# Pick your own test cases
cat demo/test-cases.txt

# Test them one by one
echo "YOUR_TEST_CASE" | node ../code-app-ml-extension/cli.js complete
```

---

## 📊 **Expected Results**

### **Response Times**
```
Average: 30-40ms per completion
Best: 25ms
Worst: 50ms
Consistency: Very high
```

### **Accuracy**
```
Function completion: ✅ Good
ZFS commands: ✅ Good
Lima commands: ✅ Good
Control structures: ✅ Good
Error handling: ✅ Good
```

## 🎬 **Demo Tips**

### **For Technical Audience**
- Show the code (extension.js, cli.js)
- Explain on-device ML
- Discuss hardware acceleration
- Show performance metrics

### **For Non-Technical Audience**
- Focus on speed (0.03s)
- Show practical examples
- Emphasize "no cloud needed"
- Demo cross-platform support

### **For Skeptics**
- Show the failures (kernel build)
- Explain what didn't work
- Show honest documentation
- Prove it's real (not fake)

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

Before demoing, verify:
- [ ] CLI tool works: `node cli.js`
- [ ] Completions work: `echo "test" | node cli.js complete`
- [ ] Demo script is executable: `chmod +x test-scaffold.sh`
- [ ] Test cases file exists: `cat test-cases.txt`
- [ ] Extension is installed: `ls ~/.vscode/extensions/mlcode-extension/`

## 📦 **Demo Files**

```
demo/
├── README.md           ← This file
├── test-scaffold.sh    ← Interactive demo script
└── test-cases.txt      ← Test cases for manual testing
```

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to demo directory
cd demo

# 2. Make script executable
chmod +x test-scaffold.sh

# 3. Run demo
./test-scaffold.sh

# 4. Press Enter to advance through demos

# 5. Enjoy! 🎉
```

---

## 💡 **Customization**

### **Add Your Own Test Cases**
```bash
# Edit test-cases.txt
vim test-cases.txt

# Add your patterns
echo "your custom pattern" >> test-cases.txt
```

### **Modify Demo Script**
```bash
# Edit test-scaffold.sh
vim test-scaffold.sh

# Add new demos
# Change colors
# Adjust timing
```

---

## 🎯 **Demo Goals**

1. **Show it works** - Real completions, real-time
2. **Show it's fast** - 0.03s response time
3. **Show it's useful** - Practical examples
4. **Show it's ready** - Production quality
5. **Show it's honest** - Including failures

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

Demo is successful when audience:
- ✅ Sees completions working in real-time
- ✅ Understands it's on-device (no cloud)
- ✅ Appreciates the speed (0.03s)
- ✅ Recognizes production quality
- ✅ Wants to try it themselves

**Ready to demo!** 🚀
