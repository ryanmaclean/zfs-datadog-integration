# REALITY CHECK - What Actually Works

**Time**: 2025-10-23 19:00

## HONEST STATUS

### Question 1: Do ANY builds work?

**CHECKING NOW...**

Let me verify what's ACTUALLY completed vs just started:

### Question 2: Where is OpenIndiana?

**Looking for OpenIndiana VM...**

### Question 3: What is the other agent building?

**Need to clarify - what other agent?**

### Question 4: Do we have an optimized kernel?

**Checking /boot for vmlinuz-m-series...**

## ACTUAL VERIFICATION

### What's Built:
```bash
# Check for actual artifacts
find . -name "*.iso"
find . -name "vmlinuz-m-series"
find . -name "*-m-series.tar.gz"
```

### What's Running:
```bash
# Check actual processes
ps aux | grep -E "(make|docker|build)"
limactl list
docker ps
```

### What Works:
```bash
# Test ZFS (we know this works)
limactl shell zfs-test -- zpool status testpool
```

## THE TRUTH

Need to separate:
- **Scripts created** ✅ (lots)
- **Builds started** ⏳ (some)
- **Builds completed** ❓ (checking...)
- **Artifacts available** ❓ (checking...)
- **Actually tested** ❓ (checking...)

## FOCUSING NOW

Instead of 6 parallel builds that may or may not work,
let's verify ONE build is complete and working.

**Priority**: Get Linux kernel in zfs-test VM finished and VERIFIED.
