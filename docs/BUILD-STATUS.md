# Build Status - Live Updates

## Current Execution: NetBSD ARM64

**Started**: 2025-10-23 18:14:03
**Status**: üü° Installing (manual installation required)
**VM**: Running on 127.0.0.1:64913

### What's Happening

NetBSD is booting from ISO. Unlike Alpine/FreeBSD which use cloud images, NetBSD requires manual installation from the installer.

### Next Steps

1. **Wait for SSH** - Lima is waiting for SSH to become available
2. **Access installer** - Once SSH is up, we can access the installer
3. **Manual install** - Follow prompts to install NetBSD to disk
4. **Reboot** - Boot from installed disk
5. **Build kernel** - Run the M-series kernel build

### Expected Timeline

- ‚è±Ô∏è ISO boot: 2-5 minutes
- ‚è±Ô∏è Manual installation: 10-20 minutes  
- ‚è±Ô∏è Kernel build: 30-60 minutes
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Total**: ~1-1.5 hours

### Other Platforms Status

| Platform | Status | Time | Notes |
|----------|--------|------|-------|
| **Alpine** | ‚úÖ Config ready | ~30min | Cloud image, auto-provision |
| **FreeBSD** | ‚úÖ Config ready | ~45min | Cloud image, auto-provision |
| **NetBSD** | üü° Installing | ~1.5hr | ISO install, manual steps |
| **OpenBSD** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental | ~1hr | ISO install, ZFS unsupported |

### Why NetBSD is Different

**Alpine/FreeBSD**: Use cloud-init images
- Boot directly to working system
- Auto-provision with cloud-init
- Ready for kernel build immediately

**NetBSD/OpenBSD**: Use installation ISOs
- Boot to installer
- Require manual installation steps
- Must reboot after install
- Then ready for kernel build

### Automation Note

After first successful NetBSD install, we can:
1. Export the VM as a base image
2. Use it for future builds
3. Skip manual installation

This is how we'll optimize for CI/CD.

### Live Monitoring

```bash
# Watch boot progress
tail -f ~/.lima/netbsd-arm64/serial.log

# Check VM status
limactl list | grep netbsd

# Check SSH attempts
tail -f ~/.lima/netbsd-arm64/ha.stderr.log
```

### Current VM Details

```
Name:       netbsd-arm64
Status:     Running
SSH:        127.0.0.1:64913
Type:       qemu
Arch:       aarch64
CPUs:       4
Memory:     8GiB
Disk:       30GiB
```

### Installation Progress

Waiting for SSH to become available...

The installer is running, but SSH won't be available until:
1. NetBSD installs to disk
2. User enables sshd during installation
3. System reboots into installed OS

### Alternative: Skip for Now

If manual installation is too time-consuming, we can:

1. **Focus on Alpine + FreeBSD** (automated, cloud images)
2. **Let CI/CD handle NetBSD** (with pre-built base image)
3. **Document NetBSD as "experimental"**

This is reasonable since:
- Alpine + FreeBSD are production-ready
- NetBSD is esoteric/experimental
- OpenBSD ZFS is even more experimental

### Decision Point

**Option 1**: Complete NetBSD installation manually now (~1 hour)
- Proves all 4 platforms work
- Creates base image for CI
- Maximum completeness

**Option 2**: Skip to Alpine/FreeBSD testing
- Faster validation
- Focus on production platforms
- NetBSD in CI later

**Recommendation**: Skip to Alpine for now, handle NetBSD in CI with pre-built image.

**Next**: Should we continue with NetBSD installation or pivot to Alpine/FreeBSD testing?
