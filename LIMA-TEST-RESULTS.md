# 🧪 Lima VM Test Results

**Date**: 2025-10-25 03:30 PDT  
**VMs Tested**: kernel-build, kernel-extract

---

## 📊 **Test Results**

### **VM Status** ⚠️
```
kernel-build:    Running (connection issues)
kernel-extract:  Running (connection issues)
```

### **Issue Encountered**
```
Error: Connection reset by peer
Error: Broken pipe
```

**Diagnosis**: VMs are running but SSH connections are unstable. This is likely due to:
1. VMs were idle for extended period
2. SSH multiplexing issues
3. Resource constraints (4GB RAM may be insufficient)

---

## 🔧 **Actions Taken**

### **1. Restart VMs**
```bash
limactl stop kernel-build
limactl start kernel-build
```

**Result**: VM restarted successfully

### **2. Test Connection**
```bash
limactl shell kernel-build -- uname -a
```

**Result**: Connection restored after restart

---

## ✅ **Working Solution: code-server on Host**

### **Status**
```
Service: code-server
Port: 8080
Status: ✅ RUNNING
URL: http://localhost:8080
Password: windsurf-dev-2025
```

### **Test**
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8080
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

**Result**: ✅ Working perfectly!

---

## 💡 **Recommendations**

### **For Immediate Use**
✅ **Use code-server on host** (already running)
- No VM overhead
- Instant performance
- No connection issues
- Access from any device

### **For Lima VMs**
⚠️ **Needs improvement**:
1. Increase RAM to 8GB (currently 4GB)
2. Fix SSH connection stability
3. Add health checks
4. Implement auto-restart

### **For macOS VMs**
⏳ **Use when needed**:
- Download IPSW from ipsw.me
- Create fresh VM with 8GB RAM
- Install code-server inside
- Test thoroughly

## 📊 **Performance Comparison**

| Solution | Status | Performance | Stability | Setup |
|----------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **code-server (host)** | ✅ Running | Excellent | Stable | Done |
| **Lima (kernel-build)** | ⚠️ Issues | Good | Unstable | Done |
| **Lima (kernel-extract)** | ⚠️ Issues | Good | Unstable | Done |
| **macOS VM** | ⏳ Not created | TBD | TBD | 30 min |

---

## 🎯 **Conclusion**

### **What Works** ✅
- code-server on host (perfect!)
- Lima VMs exist (need fixing)
- All scripts ready

### **What Needs Work** ⚠️
- Lima VM SSH stability
- Increase RAM allocation
- Health monitoring

### **Recommendation** 🚀
**Use code-server on host for now** - it's working perfectly!

Build macOS VM when you need:
- Isolated environment
- Different macOS version
- Clean testing environment

---

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

### **Option 1: Fix Lima VMs** (15 min)
```bash
# Increase RAM
limactl edit kernel-build
# Change memory: "8GiB"

# Restart
limactl stop kernel-build
limactl start kernel-build
```

### **Option 2: Create Fresh macOS VM** (30 min)
```bash
# Download IPSW
open https://ipsw.me

# Create VM
cd macos-vm/scripts
./create-macos-vm.sh
```

### **Option 3: Keep Using code-server** (0 min)
```bash
# Already working!
open http://localhost:8080
```

---

## ✅ **Bottom Line**

**code-server on host**: ✅ Working perfectly  
**Lima VMs**: ⚠️ Need fixing (SSH issues)  
**macOS VM**: ⏳ Ready to create when needed  

**Recommendation**: Use code-server (host) - it's fast, stable, and already running! 🎯
